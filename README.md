# Sofia + Astro = Sofiaa! ðŸš€
A complete rewrite of my previous [online CV/portfolio](https://github.com/sahmed9833-ug/sofia.bio) using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Why the rewrite?
- I was _bored_
- I wasn't happy with [sofia.bio](https://github.com/sahmed9833-ug/sofia.bio).
  - Having been written before [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/blog/announcing-sveltekit-1.0) became available the old website lacks Server-side rendering, making SEO a complete non-starter (not that I cared when I wrote it).
  - While Svelte and Firebase were great fun to work with it was overkill for the purposes of my website. _An over-engineered solution is a bad one_.
  - A relatively straight-forward [Multi-page application (MPA)](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/) with minimal JavaScript is much more sensible way to go.
  - While I'm still a fan of the utilitarian approach I took with the design, it was beginning to grow stale and I felt like something with a little more _pizzazz_.
- I wanted to dip my toes into the world of Tailwind and throwing myself into the deep-end by using it to style a website from scratch seemed a good way to go about it.
- Did I mention I was bored?

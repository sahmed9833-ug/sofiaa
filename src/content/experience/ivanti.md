roles:
  - title: Associate Software Engineer
    description: Joined Ivanti as part of a new, cross-functional product team focused on building offerings for the Supply Chain industry. Collaborating with teams in the US and Warsaw.<br><br>Worked on a terminal app called Velocity, delivering bug fixes, features, and later its port to iOS. <br>This position introduced me to some fun new areas of software development, Mobile & Desktop apps; integrating SDKs from both software and hardware providers; and the art of QA. Velocity's customers include some of the world's largest Supply Chain companies whose driving force is improving operational efficiency. To that end, we had in place a regimented QA strategy that involved cross-team collaboration and phased rollouts to ensure customers only ever got the best experience.<br><br>Later, as part of Ivanti's transition away from licenses to a SaaS-based model we would be tasked with building products for the company-wide Ivanti Neurons platform. These products would tightly integrate with the Velocity app already on customers' devices, providing value as well as cross-sell opportunities.
